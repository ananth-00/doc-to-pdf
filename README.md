DOCX to PDF Converter
Project Overview
This project is a robust and efficient DOCX to PDF converter designed to streamline the process of converting Microsoft Word documents into PDF format. Built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, the converter ensures that users can quickly and accurately convert their DOCX files into universally accessible PDFs, preserving the original formatting and layout.

Key Features
Accurate Conversion: Maintains the integrity of the original DOCX document, including text formatting, images, tables, and other embedded objects.
Batch Processing: Supports converting multiple DOCX files to PDF in one go, saving time for users handling large volumes of documents.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design that allows users to drag and drop files or select them through a file picker for conversion.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly on various operating systems, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
Lightweight and Fast: Optimized for speed and minimal resource usage, ensuring quick conversions without compromising system performance.
FastAPI Integration: Utilizes FastAPI to create a powerful and efficient web API, enabling users to convert DOCX files to PDF via HTTP requests.
FastAPI Integration
The project leverages FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. With FastAPI, the DOCX to PDF converter can be deployed as a web service, allowing users to send DOCX files through HTTP POST requests and receive the converted PDF files in response.

Key Benefits of FastAPI Integration:
Asynchronous Support: FastAPI provides native support for asynchronous request handling, making the conversion process more responsive and scalable.
Automatic Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation, making it easy for developers to explore and test the API endpoints.
High Performance: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available, ensuring that the converter performs efficiently even under heavy load.
How It Works
The DOCX to PDF converter uses powerful libraries to read and interpret DOCX files, converting them into high-quality PDFs. Users can interact with the converter in two ways:

Command-Line Interface: Run the tool directly from the terminal for quick, local conversions.
FastAPI-Powered Web Service: Deploy the converter as a web service, allowing remote access to the conversion functionality via RESTful API calls.
Use Cases
Document Archiving: Convert DOCX files to PDF for long-term storage and easy sharing across different platforms.
API-Based Automation: Integrate the converter into automated workflows by sending DOCX files to the FastAPI-powered web service.
Sharing and Distribution: Ensure that your documents are accessible and viewable by anyone, regardless of the software they use.
Professional Presentations: Create polished, professional-looking PDFs from DOCX files for presentations, reports, and other formal documents.
Getting Started
To use the DOCX to PDF converter, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and either run the script locally or deploy the FastAPI service. Detailed instructions are provided in the installation guide within the repository.
